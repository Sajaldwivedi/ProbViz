# ProbViz - Competitive Programming Visualizer

**ProbViz** is a React-based web application designed to visualize competitive programming problems. It allows users to input a problem ID (e.g., from LeetCode or Codeforces) and displays detailed information such as the problem title, difficulty, description, tags, statistics, and sample test cases in a modern, interactive UI. This project showcases proficiency in frontend development with React, data visualization using Chart.js, and smooth animations with Framer Motion.

## Features
- **Problem Visualization**: Enter a problem ID to view mock data including title, difficulty, description, tags, and test cases.
- **Dynamic Charts**: Visualize problem statistics (acceptance rate, submissions, solved) using Chart.js bar charts.
- **Smooth Animations**: Leverages Framer Motion for elegant transitions and UI enhancements.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout, optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Mock Data**: Simulates API responses with predefined problem data for demonstration purposes.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: Frontend framework for building reusable UI components.
- **Chart.js & react-chartjs-2**: For rendering interactive bar charts.
- **Framer Motion**: For smooth animations and transitions.
- **CSS**: Custom styles with a modern, clean design.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core logic and state management with React hooks.
